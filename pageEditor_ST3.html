                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation of the various web pages, several challenges were encountered, each requiring thoughtful solutions to maintain functionality, design consistency, and accessibility.
                       <ul><li>One of the primary challenges was ensuring consistent navigation across all pages. With multiple sections and interactive elements, maintaining a structured and responsive navigation menu was difficult. This was resolved by using a flexbox-based navigation bar and a shared CSS file to maintain consistency across all pages.</li>
                        <li>Another challenge was styling and aligning content properly. The Team Page required a dynamic hover effect to display additional information for each team member. Initially, the details box was not displaying correctly. This was fixed by using absolute positioning and opacity transitions to ensure smooth visibility changes. Similarly, in the Feedback Page, aligning form elements while keeping them accessible and user-friendly required using fieldset and legend tags for better grouping.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The web pages comply with Janet regulations by ensuring accessibility, data security, and usability best practices.Semantic HTML improves structure and screen reader compatibility, while alt text and keyboard navigation enhance accessibility. The Feedback Page includes input validation and user consent, aligning with data protection standards.Security measures such as relative paths and controlled JavaScript usage prevent vulnerabilities. The Content Page follows readability guidelines with structured 
                        sections and high-contrast text.Consistent navigation and responsive design ensure usability across devices. While further enhancements like server-side validation and HTTPS enforcement could improve compliance, the current implementation prioritizes security, accessibility, and ethical web practices.</p>
