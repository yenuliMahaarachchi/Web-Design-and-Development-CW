                <h2 id="profile">Profile page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The User Profile Page is structured using HTML and CSS, creating a responsive and visually appealing layout. The page consists of a header with a navigation bar, a sidebar containing the user’s profile information, and a main content section displaying a biography, goals, frustrations, experience, volunteering availability, supported UN goals, and a contact form. 
                            The navigation menu is implemented using an unordered list (ul), ensuring a structured and intuitive way for users to explore different sections. The sidebar prominently features a profile picture, user details, and a list of skills represented by progress bars with varying widths to indicate proficiency levels. The main content is divided into sections, 
                            each with a heading and corresponding content, making information easily digestible. Additionally, a form is included in the contact section, allowing users to input their details and send messages.
                        </p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In terms of accessibility, the page follows good practices by using proper semantic HTML elements such as headings (h1, h2, h3) and providing alt attributes for images, ensuring screen readers can interpret visual content. However, improvements can be made to enhance usability for all users. The contrast between white text and the blue background in some sections may be insufficient for visually impaired users, 
                            and adjusting the text color or background can improve readability. The navigation menu lacks :focus styles, which can make it difficult for keyboard users to navigate efficiently; adding focus indicators (outline: 2px solid yellow;) would address this issue. Additionally, form labels should be explicitly linked to their respective input fields using the for attribute to improve screen reader compatibility. 
                            Icons used alongside headings should also include aria-label attributes or more descriptive alt text for better accessibility. Lastly, the footer has positioning issues (margin-left: -600px; width: 190.3%), which may cause layout shifts, particularly on smaller screens, and should be revised using flexbox or grid for proper alignment. By addressing these accessibility improvements, the page will become more inclusive, offering a better user experience for individuals with diverse needs.</p>

                <h2 id="sitemap">Sitemap page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Visual Sitemap is an HTML-based webpage that provides a structured representation of the website's navigation. It utilizes SVG elements to create a hierarchical diagram where different pages are displayed as nodes connected by lines with directional arrows. The page includes a navigation menu with links to key sections, a search bar, and a "Back to Top" button to enhance usability. The design is managed through global.
                            css and sitemap.css for styling, ensuring a visually organized layout. The footer section includes social media links and additional navigation options, improving accessibility and user engagement. This sitemap serves as a clear reference for understanding the website’s structure and content flow.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The sitemap follows several accessibility best practices, but there are areas for improvement. The use of semantic HTML elements, such as header, nav, and footer, enhances compatibility with screen readers. However, SVG accessibility could be improved by including title and desc elements to describe the diagram for users who rely on assistive technologies. 
                            The search bar lacks a label, which can be addressed by adding label for="search"> for better clarity. Additionally, the social media icons in the footer are missing alt text, which should be added to support screen readers. While the sitemap is keyboard-friendly, stronger focus indicators would improve navigation for users who do not use a mouse. These refinements would help ensure a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.</p>

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Content Page is designed to present information about the global water crisis in a structured and user-friendly manner. It includes a navigation menu for quick access to different sections, 
                            a search bar for ease of exploration, and a "Back to Top" button for seamless scrolling. The page is divided into multiple sections, each addressing different aspects of the water crisis, such as health implications, 
                            economic impact, and potential solutions. Visually, it incorporates background images, a blue-toned color scheme, and well-spaced content blocks, ensuring readability and engagement. The use of responsive images and shadowed content sections enhances the overall design, 
                            making the page both informative and aesthetically appealing.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>For accessibility, the page follows semantic HTML structure, with appropriate heading levels and alt attributes for images, ensuring screen reader compatibility. The color contrast is generally sufficient, 
                            though some footer text could be improved for readability. The page supports keyboard navigation, but adding clearer focus indicators and labels for the search bar would enhance usability for users relying on assistive technologies. 
                            The layout is mostly responsive, but ensuring images adapt properly on smaller screens with max-width: 100% would improve mobile accessibility. With minor refinements, the page could offer a fully inclusive experience for all users.</p>
